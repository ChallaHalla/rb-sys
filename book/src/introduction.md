# Ruby on Rust

This book describes how to use [Rust][rust] to build fast, reliable and secure native gems for [Ruby][ruby]. You may be
new to Rust, and that's OK! You'll find that Rust has many of the things you love about Ruby. And unlike C, incorrect
code will usually fail at compile time rather than bringing down production.

By the end of this book, you will be confident to build, test, and deploy a Rusty Ruby gem of your own! If you get stuck
along the way or want to improve Ruby on Rust, [please join our Slack channel][chat]!
